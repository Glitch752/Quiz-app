# Quiz-app

This is a simple quiz application I made using firebase to store data in the cloud.
In the future, I may turn this into something like [Gimkit](https://www.gimkit.com/) with games based around solving questions, but for now it's just simple quizzes.

## Screenshots

This project allows for you to view quizzes made by others,
![quiz-list](https://github.com/Glitch752/Quiz-app/blob/master/Images/FindQuizzes.jpg?raw=true)

host those quizzes,
![host-quiz](https://github.com/Glitch752/Quiz-app/blob/master/Images/ServerLobby.jpg?raw=true)

join them,
![join-quiz](https://github.com/Glitch752/Quiz-app/blob/master/Images/JoinQuiz.jpg?raw=true)

and take them.

It also allows you to create your own quizzes,
![create-quiz](https://github.com/Glitch752/Quiz-app/blob/master/Images/CreateQuiz.jpg?raw=true)
![create-quiz-question](https://github.com/Glitch752/Quiz-app/blob/master/Images/CreateQuizQuestions.jpg?raw=true)

and view or take other people's quizzes.
![view-quiz](https://github.com/Glitch752/Quiz-app/blob/master/Images/ViewQuiz.jpg?raw=true)

I might add more game modes to this project eventually, but it's mostly intended to be a project to learn about firebase.
